## Overview

The **Overview** page provides a high-level summary of the airport's performance. Key metrics displayed include:

- Total number of flights
- Average delay times
- On-time performance percentage
- Number of delayed flights
- Passenger satisfaction scores

This page is designed to give a quick snapshot of overall airport efficiency and key performance indicators.

## Delays and Time Analysis

The **Delays and Time Analysis** page dives deeper into flight delays and their impact on airport operations. This section includes:

- **Delay Trends**: Visualizations showing the trend of delays over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
- **Delay Causes**: Analysis of the primary causes of delays (e.g., weather, technical issues, air traffic control).
- **Peak Delay Times**: Identification of times of day and days of the week with the highest delays.
- **Delay Distribution**: Distribution of delays by duration (e.g., 0-15 minutes, 16-30 minutes, etc.).

This analysis helps identify patterns and potential areas for operational improvements.

## Detailed Flight Analysis

The **Detailed Flight Analysis** page offers an in-depth look at individual flight data. Key features include:

- **Flight Performance**: Performance metrics for specific flights, including departure and arrival times, delays, and cancellations.
- **Route Analysis**: Analysis of performance by routes, identifying the best and worst-performing routes.
- **Airline Comparison**: Comparison of different airlines' performance, including on-time rates and average delays.
- **Passenger Insights**: Insights into passenger volume, satisfaction, and feedback on specific flights.

This detailed analysis supports granular investigation into specific flights and routes to identify improvement opportunities.
